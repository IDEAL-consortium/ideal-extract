**Research Method** (choose one or more; best guess, output just the heading):

- Regression discontinuity
- Instrumental variables (IV)
- Difference in difference
- Fixed-effect (not DiD)
- Statistical matching
- Synthetic control
- Simple comparison (interrupted time series (ITS), convenience comparison group, or other methods)

Multiple methods may be used in combination (e.g., matching + DiD). In that case, list each method in the `method` array.
